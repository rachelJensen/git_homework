## Takeways
1. Google like your life depends on it. Googling well takes practice, but it's well worth the effort.
2. Everything is going to be new and it's okay if that feels overwhelming. Just chip away at it. Practice. Read or take notes repeatedly as needed. Don't get too stressed if things take a lot of time at first exposure.
